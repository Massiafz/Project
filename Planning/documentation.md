# Documentation Plan

### Developer Documentation:
Moksh, Massi, and Vincent will be responsible for writing and maintaining the developer documentation, including code documentation, system architecture, and setup guides.

### User / In-Application Documentation:
Massi, Bach, and Jason will also create the user manual, FAQs, and tooltips, ensuring the customer has clear guidance on using the album cataloging system.

## Code Documentation:
