# Documentation Plan

## Developer Documentation:
Moksh, Massi, and Vincent will be responsible for writing and maintaining the developer documentation, including code documentation, system architecture, and setup guides.

## User / In-Application Documentation:
Massi, Bach, and Jason will also create the user manual, FAQs, and tooltips, ensuring the customer has clear guidance on using the album cataloging system.

# 📌 Setup Guide: Install, Configure, and Run BrightByte Music Cataloging Software

## 📖 Overview
BrightByte Music Cataloging Software is a Python-based application that helps users manage and browse a catalog of music albums. This guide provides step-by-step instructions to install, configure, and run the software.

---
## 🔧 Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure the following dependencies are installed:

### ✅ Python 3
Check if Python is installed by running:
```sh
python --version
```
If not installed, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### ✅ pip (Python Package Manager)
Verify pip installation with:
```sh
pip --version
```

### ✅ Git
Ensure Git is installed by running:
```sh
git --version
```
If not installed, download Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

---
## 📥 Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
Open a terminal and run:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Massiafz/Project.git
cd Project
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
Install required Python libraries with:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Alternatively, if a `Makefile` is provided, install dependencies using:
```sh
make install
```
> 💡 **Note:** Windows users without `make` should use `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

---
## 🚀 Running the Software

### 1️⃣ Run the Program
Navigate to the directory containing `main.py`:
```sh
cd Code
```
Run the application with:
```sh
python main.py
```
Or explicitly using Python 3:
```sh
python3 main.py
```

### 2️⃣ Running Data Processing & Analysis *(If applicable)*
If data processing is included, run:
```sh
make process
make plot
```
> 💡 **Note:** Windows users may need to replace `make` commands with direct Python script execution.

---
## ✅ Running Tests *(If applicable)*
If tests exist, execute:
```sh
make test
```
> *(Currently, no `test` target is defined in the `Makefile`. Add it if needed.)*

---
## 🧹 Cleaning Up
To remove temporary files and cached data:
```sh
make clean
```
> 💡 You may be prompted for confirmation before deletion.

---
## 📌 Additional Notes
- Ensure all required data files (e.g., `data.csv`) are in the correct directories before running the application.
- Windows users may need to use `python` instead of `python3`, and `pip` instead of `pip3`.
- Additional setup may be required for deployment.

---
🎵 **Enjoy using BrightByte Music Cataloging Software!** 🎶


## 🛠️ Troubleshooting & Debugging Guide

### 📖 Overview
This guide provides solutions to common installation, configuration, and runtime issues encountered while using this software. Follow the steps outlined below to diagnose and resolve problems efficiently.

---

## 🔧 1. Installation Issues

### ❌ Problem: Error Installing Dependencies
**Solution:**
1. Verify that Python and pip are correctly installed:
   ```sh
   python --version
   pip --version
   ```
2. If these commands fail, install or reinstall Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).
3. If errors occur when installing from `requirements.txt`, try upgrading pip:
   ```sh
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   ```
4. Ensure all package names are correctly specified in `requirements.txt`.

### ❌ Problem: Makefile Commands Fail (Linux/macOS)
